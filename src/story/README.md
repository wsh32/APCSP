# APCSP Story
Story Assignment for AP Computer Science Principles

Run `main.py` using Python 3.5 or find it on [repl.it](https://repl.it/EMJB/31)

To import a story:

1. Create a TSV file as so:
`id\tbackground\tchoice1\tchoice2\tchoice3\tresult1\tresult2\tresult3\tscore`
2. Move the file to `/src/file.txt`
3. Change line 11 in `main.py` to `i = import_steps('file.txt')`
4. Run `steps.py`

The excel sheet used to make the TSV is included.
